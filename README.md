AUDLAndroid
===========

Android application for AUDL


Building and Running the application
===================================

The build requires android SDK to be installed to your development environment.  In addition you'll need to set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to the location of your SDK:

export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/tools/android-sdk

The application can be checked out to an eclipse IDE with ADT plugin installed. The application can be built and run using the default emulator or using any device.

The emulator used for testing is https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/launchpad/download/. This seems to be faster than the default emulator
