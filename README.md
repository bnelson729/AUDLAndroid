AUDLAndroid
===========

Android application for AUDL


Building and Running the application
===================================

Requirements:
-----------------------
>1) Setup ADT bundle with eclipse
>>1) Further instructions in http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html
>2) Git installed (you can do the following stuff without git but I'm not going to show how).

The application can be checked out to an eclipse IDE with ADT plugin installed. The application can be built and run using the default emulator or using any device.

The emulator used for testing is https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/launchpad/download/. This seems to be faster than the default emulator

Download and install:
-----------------------
>1) Open cmd/terminal
>2) Navigate to your workspace
>3) Then type in:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/owncloud/News-Android-App.git
