AUDLAndroid
===========

Android application for AUDL


Building and Running the application
===================================

The application can be checkout out to an eclipse IDE with ADT plugin installed. The application can be built and run using the default emulator or using any device.

The emulator used for testing is https://cloud.genymotion.com/page/launchpad/download/. This seems to be faster than the default emulator
